# Implementation

![Reference Image](./image/ref_img.png)

### Functionality:
Users interface with a **`flask` front-end**, to login to their
account, search information about the bank, or contact a
representative. Once logged in, a user can process a payment
from their account, pay their credit card or request a new one,
browse information about loans or request one, and obtain
information about wealth management options. The back-end
databases consist of **in-memory `memcached`**, and **persistent `MongoDB`** instances. The service also has a **relational database**
(BankInfoDB) that includes information about the bank, its
services, and representatives.
